ARTillery is an application created to make photo searching easier. Originally, the purpose of the app was to allow users to turn Instagram photos into pieces of canvas art and be delivered to your door (hence the name ARTillery). However, I came to realize that photo searching itself was much to difficult and pivoted with a totally new concept.
