ARTillery
=========

Artillery is an application designed to make searching for photos easier. Originally an app designed to produce physical artwork from Instagram (hence the name), the concept pivoted to cater towards the overall searching aspect of photos online and off.

Just a git pull and a bundle install to get this up and running. Other than that, all you would need is an Instagram account to access your own pictures!
